The model dynamically retrains based on performance, utilizing a Standard Scaler for data normalization. Real-time accuracy metrics guide adaptive retraining intervals to enhance prediction reliability. The script is equipped to handle both real-time and offline predictions, ensuring robust operation even in case of connectivity issues.",
